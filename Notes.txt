Next Steps:





The distinction depends on your intended functionality:

chat:

Establishes a persistent session with a specific user.
For example, messages could flow between the two users until one exits the session.
message:

Sends a single message without initiating a session.
Similar to sending an email or a one-off notification.
For your code:

Ensure chat sets up a session between two clients.
Ensure message supports sending a single message to an available user.
