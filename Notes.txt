Current state summary:
1.Client-to-Daemon Communication:
. Clients can connect to their respective daemons and send commands (connect, chat, quit).
. Clients are properly receiving responses from their daemon.
2. Daemon-to-Daemon Communication:
The implementation for initiating a three-way handshake (SYN, SYN+ACK, ACK) is in place but requires verification and testing.
Currently, the daemon correctly identifies when a client attempts to chat with itself.


Next Steps:
1.Add logging to every critical point of the handshake.
2.Run two daemons locally to verify communication.
3.Validate datagram serialization and deserialization.
4.Adjust timeouts for debugging.
