Current state summary:
Initialization: Sockets are set up correctly for both client and daemon communication.
Client-Server Interaction: Partial functionality for connect, chat, and message commands.
Inter-Daemon Communication: Basic structure for sending and handling control datagrams exists but lacks full implementation.
Error Handling: Basic logging and error detection are present, but some cases (e.g., missing users) are not handled gracefully.





Next Steps:
Fix Missing Attributes:

Replace connected_users with the existing user_directory.
Add any additional tracking structures needed for message delivery and chat states.
Implement Control Datagram Logic:

Complete the handling of SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, and FIN to establish and terminate chat sessions reliably.
Message Routing Logic:

Ensure messages from one client reach the intended recipient, even across daemons.
Client-User Management:

Finalize connect and chat commands to register users and handle chat requests effectively.
Testing and Debugging:

Test the chat flow between two clients connected to the same daemon and across different daemons.




The distinction depends on your intended functionality:

chat:

Establishes a persistent session with a specific user.
For example, messages could flow between the two users until one exits the session.
message:

Sends a single message without initiating a session.
Similar to sending an email or a one-off notification.
For your code:

Ensure chat sets up a session between two clients.
Ensure message supports sending a single message to an available user.
